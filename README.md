Greetings and felicitations to everything
This is an exciting foray into version control, inspired by the Finnish guy with the long ponytail who gave a presentation about it in which nobody could read the slides and he never responded when asked to make them available. It was super-boring at the time and yet, having lost a bunch of code, I obviously need to learn version control so here I am. Hello.
